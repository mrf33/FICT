Abstract :

An experment in designing an android application that provides the user with a simple user-interface and methods 
to exploit some connectivity features the likes of GPS , internet connection and delvire it to the last one with 
stable pase of interactivity .


Intoduction :

Certain requirements were given before hand to-which our application were destined to satisfy , although not all of them
meet accourdingly as well as some weren't meant to meet yet it has . Different factors can play a rolle in that specialy under-going
unstable development phase with tight timelimit. No matter how clear were the vision in-which we viewed our application to be before
the development phase, most of it changed in the process ,but certainly it became way clearer .

The actual design, coding phase took a reasonable amount of our given time in comparison to the amount spent in debuging and use-testing .
Furthermore the actual chanlnging part as we didn't expect was the debuging and getting the application to run on an actual android device
taking in considration the differances between each version of the os and how the code and development-kit used will certainly differe just as much .
Not to mention the lack of experince in this field , of software development which evadntly effected the pase of over-all progress to the 
declining end unfortantly .

Nevertheless the choice of going with one of the Idea ,Android studio in our case, as oppose to the given framework was an addtional chalnge
that we expected taking in consideration the lack of any advanced Java knowledg since were're taking java 1 as a subject curently, the abslut
lack of knowledg in regard to mobile-systems development . Yet the massive amount of knowledge that we can gain from taking such chalnge was 
the ultimate goal and where all the ends met .


Methodalogy :

# Framework
Android studio was our choice of development framework as mentioned previously , reasoning to-which we chose as so 

- Stablity : Since its considered the one most complete, relayable framework that has been constainly updated and improved on 
- Community support : This factor was the most important to us , since the lack of knowledge and experince mentioned previously
- Ease : It's considered to-be the simplest idea out of the rest by far .

# Platform
Android 5 (Glybeans) the base of our support went to this version with older android versions down to 4.2 , reasoning to-why 

- High existing support : so since it scored well-over 70% precent of android devices out-there accourding to Google play including the
other mentioned factors , which noticbly other older version lack and newer versions support but we've had to scrifaice the platform support
